# Weighted GPA Calculator
## A calculator for you to *easily* calculate your weighted grade point average 🏫

In the future, I plan on adding these things to this calculator and *try* to use git to upload changes.

1. Make the code more efficient
2. Add custom classes so that you can enter even more than the core area classes
3. Include automatic grade calculator so that if you enter numbers on a scale from 1-100, it will calculate the letter grade for you.
4. Make the calculator into an official app :D

These changes will happen over the span of a lot of time, so keep an eye on it 😄
